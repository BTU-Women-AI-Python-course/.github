   - **Topics:**
     - **Lists and List Comprehensions** - https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp:

         Lists are ordered collections that are mutable and can contain mixed data types. List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.
      
     - **Tuples and Dictionaries** - https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp:

   - **Topics:**
       - **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: 
           - Learn about how inheritance allows classes to derive from other classes and how polymorphism enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class.
   
       - **Encapsulation and Abstraction**: 
           - Understand how encapsulation restricts direct access to some of an object's components and how abstraction allows focusing on essential qualities rather than specific characteristics.
